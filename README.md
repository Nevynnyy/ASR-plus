# ASR-plus
Adaptive Sparse Representations for recognition of faces and facial attributes

# Abstract
This algorithms has been tested on two different recognition problems:
1) Recognition of facial attributes (like expressions, gender, etc.) and
2) Face recognition. For the 1) and 2) tasks the reader is referred to
our publications [1] and [2] respectively. It is the same code but with
different parameters. For 1) run demo_eccv2014.m, for 2) run 
demo_wifs2014.m.

# Requirements
To run ASR+, following Matlab Toolboxes are required:                   
- [VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org)                             
- [Balu](https://github.com/domingomery/Balu)            
- [SPAMS](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/downloads.html) 

# Demos
Please run:
- demo_eccv2014.m for demo of paper presented at ECCV2004
- demo_wifs2014.m for demo of paper presented at WIFS2004
